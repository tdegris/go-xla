## 🎯 Why use go-xla ?

<img align="right" width="220px" height="220px" alt="GoMLX Gopher" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/346d8b1b-8bf0-4f95-938d-bc13fdca630b" />

The **go-xla** project leverages [OpenXLA's](https://openxla.org/) to (JIT-) compile, optimize, and **accelerate numeric computations**
(with large data) from Go using various [backends supported by OpenXLA](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/03/pjrt-plugin-to-accelerate-machine-learning.html): CPU, GPUs (Nvidia, AMD ROCm*, Intel*, Apple Metal*) and TPUs. 
It can be used to power Machine Learning frameworks (e.g. [GoMLX](https://github.com/gomlx/gomlx)), image processing, scientific 
computation, game AIs, etc. 

And because [Jax](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and 
[optionally PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/xla/release/2.3/index.html) run on XLA, it is possible to run Jax functions in Go with **go-xla**, 
and probably TensorFlow and PyTorch as well.

The **go-xla** project aims to be minimalist and robust: it provides well-maintained, extensible Go wrappers for
[OpenXLA's StableHLO](https://openxla.org/#stablehlo) and [OpenXLA's PJRT](https://openxla.org/#pjrt). 

The APIs are not very "ergonomic" (error handling everywhere), but it's expected to be a stable building block for
other projects to create a friendlier API on top. 
The same way [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python friendlier API on top of XLA/PJRT.

One such friendlier API co-developed with **go-xla** is [GoMLX, a Go machine learning framework](https://github.com/gomlx/gomlx).
But **go-xla** may be used as a standalone, for lower level access to XLA and other accelerator use cases—like running
Jax functions in Go, maybe an "accelerated" image processing or scientific simulation pipeline.

## 🧭 What is what?

### **PJRT** - "Pretty much Just another RunTime."

It is the heart of the OpenXLA project: it takes an IR (intermediate representation, typically _StableHLO_) of the "computation graph,"
JIT (Just-In-Time) compiles it (once) and executes it fast (many times). 
See the [Google's "PJRT: Simplifying ML Hardware and Framework Integration"](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/05/pjrt-simplifying-ml-hardware-and-framework-integration.html) blog post.

A "computation graph" is the part of your program (usually vectorial math/machine learning related) that one
wants to "accelerate." 

The PJRT comes in the form of a _plugin_, a dynamically linked library (`.so` file in Linux, or optionally 
`.dylib` in Darwin, or `.dll` in Windows). Typically, there is one plugin per hardware you are supporting. 
E.g.: there are PJRT plugins for CPU (Linux/amd64 and macOS for now, but likely it could be compiled for
other CPUs -- SIMD/AVX are well-supported), for TPUs (Google's accelerator), 
GPUs (Nvidia and AMD ROCm are well-supported; there are Intel's PJRT plugins, but they were not tested), 
and others are in development. Some PJRT plugins are not open-source, but are available for download.

The **go-xla** project provides the package `github.com/gomlx/go-xla/pjrt`, 
a Go API for dynamically loading and calling the **PJRT** runtime.
It also provides a installer (`github.com/gomlx/go-xla/cmd/pjrt_installer`) or library (`github.com/gomlx/go-xla/installer`) to 
auto-install (download pre-compiled binaries) **PJRT** plugins for CPU (from GitHub), 
CUDA (from pypi.org Jax packages), ROCm (from AMD's manylinux repository) and TPU (also from pypi.org).

### **StableHLO** - "Stable High Level Optimization" (?)

The currently better supported IR (intermediary representation) supported by PJRT, see specs 
in [StableHLO docs](https://openxla.org/stablehlo). It's a text representation of the computation
that can easily be parsed by computers, but not easily written or read by humans.

The package [`github.com/gomlx/go-xla/stablehlo`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gomlx/go-xla/stablehlo)
provides a Go API for writing StableHLO programs, including _shape inference_, needed to correctly 
infer the output shape of operations as the program is being built.

Hightlights:

- _Shardy_ is supported, to allow for distributed computations.
- Dynamic (or "polymorphic") shapes is supported: with the caveat that PJRT doesn't execute "dynamically shaped"
  computations, it on-the-fly resolves and compiles to the shape of the input at runtime. So if the input is really
  dynamic, it is horribly slow.
- _Quantization_ is supported according to specification. Unfortunately, the default PJRT doesn't seem to support it (
  so it can't be executed yet).

### Package `compute/xla`

Implements an XLA backend for the `github.com/gomlx/compute` project. By simply importing this, you make an XLA
backend available for use, for instance, with GoMLX. It's actually imported by default in GoMLX for the platforms that
support it.

See details in [compute/xla/README.md](https://github.com/gomlx/go-xla/blob/master/compute/xla/README.md).

### Package `installer` and `cmd/pjrt_installer`

Installs latest pre-built PJRT for CPU, CUDA (using Jax distribution in pypi.org), ROCm (using Jax
distribution from AMD's manylinux repository) or TPU (also using Jax distribution form pypi.org) .

## 🗺️ How to use it?

Use the `stablehlo` to define your computation. Then use `pjrt` to compile (once) and execute it.

### [`github.com/gomlx/go-xla/stablehlo`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gomlx/go-xla/pjrt)

* Create a `Builder` object with `stablehlo.NewBuilder()`
* Create a `Main` function with `Builder.Main()` (or other functions with `Builder.NewFunction()`)
* Define the function using the various operations defined in `stablehlo`. Their inputs and outputs are `*stablehlo.Value`
  types, which hold a reference to the `Function` they are defined in, as well as their `shapes.Shape`.
* Finish functions with `Function.Return(values...)`.
* Finish the _StableHLO_ program with `Builder.Build()`, it will return a string with the program, that can be fed to
  `pjrt` for compiling and execution.

Here is a sample of the `stablehlo` Go API, to create a module that calculates $f(x) = x^2+1$ (without the error handling lines):

```go
					builder := stablehlo.New("x_times_x_plus_1") // Use valid identifier for module name
					scalarF32 := shapes.Make(dtypes.F32)         // Scalar float32 shape
					mainFn := builder.Main()
					x, err := mainFn.NamedInput("x", scalarF32)
					fX, err := stablehlo.Multiply(x, x)
					one, err := mainFn.ConstantFromScalar(float32(1))
					fX, err = stablehlo.Add(fX, one)
					err = mainFn.Return(fX) // Set the return value for the main function
					stableHLOCode, err := builder.Build()
					fmt.Printf("StableHLO:\n%s\n", string(stableHLOCode))
```

Here is the _StableHLO_ text generated:

```mlir
module @x_times_x_plus_1 {
  func.func @main(%x: tensor<f32>) -> tensor<f32> {
    %0 = "stablehlo.multiply"(%x, %x) : (tensor<f32>, tensor<f32>) -> tensor<f32>
    %1 = "stablehlo.constant"() { value = dense<1.0> : tensor<f32> } : () -> tensor<f32>
    %2 = "stablehlo.add"(%0, %1) : (tensor<f32>, tensor<f32>) -> tensor<f32>
    "stablehlo.return"(%2) : (tensor<f32>) -> ()
  }
}
```

### [`github.com/gomlx/go-xla/pjrt`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gomlx/go-xla/pjrt)

The `pjrt` package includes the following main concepts:

* `Plugin`: represents a PJRT plugin. It is created by calling `pjrt.GetPlugin(name)` (where `name` is the name of the plugin).
  It is the main entry point to the PJRT plugin.
* `Client`: first thing created after loading a plugin. It seems one can create a singleton `Client` per plugin,
  it's not very clear to me why one would create more than one `Client`.
* `LoadedExecutable`: Created when one calls `Client.Compile` a StableHLO program. The program is compiled and optimized
  to the PJRT target hardware and made ready to run.
* `Buffer`: Represents a buffer with the input/output data for the computations in the accelerators. There are 
  methods to transfer it to/from the host memory. They are the inputs and outputs of `LoadedExecutable.Execute`.

Example on how to run the computation with `pjrt`:

```go
var flagPluginName = flag.String("plugin", "cuda", "PRJT plugin name or full path")
...
err := installer.AutoInstall()  // Installs all supported plugin(s) if not already installed.
plugin, err := pjrt.GetPlugin(*flagPluginName)
client, err := plugin.NewClient(nil)
executor, err := client.Compile().WithStableHLO(stableHLOCode).Done()
for ii, value := range []float32{minX, minY, maxX, maxY} {
   inputs[ii], err = pjrt.ScalarToBuffer(m.client, value)
}
outputs, err := m.exec.Execute(inputs...).Done()
flat, err := pjrt.BufferToArray[float32](outputs[0])
outputs[0].Destroy() // Don't wait for the GC, destroy the buffer immediately.
...
```

## Installation of PJRT plugin

Most programs may simply add a call `installer.AutoInstall()` and it will automatically download the PJRT plugin
to the user's local home (`${HOME}/.local/lib/go-xla/` in Linux, `${HOME}/Library/Application Support/go-xla` in MacOS), 
if not installed already. 
It also auto-installs Nvidia PJRT plugin and required libraries if it's present.

To manually install it, or if you want a specific version, consider using the command line installer with 
`go run github.com/gomlx/go-xla/cmd/pjrt_installer@latest` and follow the
self-explanatory menu (or provide the flags for a quiet installation). 
Or run it with `go run github.com/gomlx/go-xla/cmd/pjrt_installer@latest -autoinstall`.


## 🤔 FAQ

* **When is feature X from PJRT going to be supported ?**
  The **go-xla** project doesn't wrap everything—although it does cover the most common operations. 
  The simple ops and structs are auto-generated. But many require hand-writing.
  Please, if it is useful to your project, create an issue; I'm happy to add it. 
  I focus on the needs of GoMLX, but the idea is that it can serve other purposes, and I'm happy to support it.

* **Why does PJRT spit out so many logs? Can we disable it?**
  This is a great question ... imagine if every library we use decided they also want to clutter our stderr?
  I have [an open question in Abseil about it](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/discussions/1700).
  It may be some issue with [Abseil Logging](https://abseil.io/docs/python/guides/logging) which also has this other issue
  of not allowing two different linked programs/libraries to call its initialization (see [Issue #1656](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/issues/1656)).
  A hacky workaround is duplicating fd 2 and assign to Go's `os.Stderr`, and then close fd 2, so PJRT plugins
  won't have where to log. This hack is encoded in the function `pjrt.SuppressAbseilLoggingHack()`: call it
  before calling `pjrt.GetPlugin`. But it may have unintended consequences if some other library depends
  on the fd 2 to work, or if a real exceptional situation needs to be reported and is not.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables that help control or debug how PJRT works:

* `PJRT_PLUGIN_LIBRARY_PATH`: Path to search for PJRT plugins. 
  The `pjrt` package also searches in `/usr/local/lib/go-xla`, `${HOME}/.local/lib/go-xla`, in
  the standard library paths for the system, and in the paths defined in `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
  For compatibility with the older version, it also searches in 
  `/usr/local/lib/gomlx/pjrt`, `${HOME}/.local/lib/gomlx/pjrt`.
  In MacOS it's the equivalent under `${HOME}/Library/Application Support/`.
* `XLA_FLAGS`: Used by the C++ PJRT plugins. Documentation is linked by the [Jax XLA_FLAGS page](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/xla_flags.html),
  but I found it easier to just set this to "--help" and it prints out the flags.
* `XLA_DEBUG_OPTIONS`: If set, it is parsed as a `DebugOptions` proto that
  is passed during the JIT-compilation (`Client.Compile()`) of a computation graph.
  It is not documented how it works in PJRT (e.g., I observed a great slow down when this is set,
  even if set to the default values), but [the proto has some documentation](https://github.com/gomlx/go-xla/blob/main/protos/xla.proto#L40).
